Others make plans: I'm going to have a husband, a home, two children, a house in the country.

They get their car, sometimes they even get a Ferrari, and they think that's the meaning of life, and they never question it.

Happiness comes from living as you need to, as you want to. As your inner voice tells you to. Happiness comes from being who you actually are instead of who you think you are supposed to be. Being traditional is not traditional anymore. It\u2019s funny that we still think of it that way. Normalize your lives, people. You don\u2019t want a baby? Don\u2019t have one. I don\u2019t want to get married? I won\u2019t. You want to live alone? Enjoy it. You want to love someone? Love someone. Don\u2019t apologize. Don\u2019t explain. Don\u2019t ever feel less than. When you feel the need to apologize or explain who you are, it means the voice in your head is telling you the wrong story. Wipe the slate clean. And rewrite it. No fairy tales. Be your own narrator.
