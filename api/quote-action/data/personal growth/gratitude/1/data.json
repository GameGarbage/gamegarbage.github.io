Each day has its great grief or its little care. Yesterday you were trembling for the health of one who is dear to you, today you fear for your own; tomorrow it will be an anxiety about money, the next day the slanders of a calumniator, the day after the misfortune of a friend; then the weather, then something broken or lost, then a pleasure for which you are reproached by your conscience or your vertebral column; another time, the course of public affairs. Not to mention heartaches. And so on. One cloud is dissipated, another gathers. Hardly one day in a hundred of unbroken joy and sunshine. And you are of that small number who are lucky!

It is impossible to name all of the circumstances in my life I\u2019ve taken for granted. All of the basic needs I\u2019ve had met, all of the friendships and job opportunities and financial blessings and the list, truly, goes on and on. The fact that I am breathing is a miracle, one I too rarely stop to appreciate. I\u2019m stopping, right now, to be grateful for everything I am and everything I\u2019ve been given. I\u2019m stopping, right now, to be grateful for every pleasure and every pain that has contributed to the me who sits here and writes these words. I am thankful for my life. This moment is a blessing. Each breath a gift. That I\u2019ve been able to take so much for granted is a gift, too. But it\u2019s not how I want to live\u2014not when gratitude is an option, now when wonder and awe are choices. I choose gratitude. I choose wonder. I choose awe.
