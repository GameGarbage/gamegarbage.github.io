But often I did - with time I learned where to look - and tried to fit them together. It pained me that she felt she couldn't come to me with it, but I knew it would hurt her more to know that I'd uncovered what she hadn't intended for me to find. In some fundamental way I think she objected to being known. Or resented it even as she longed for it. It offended her sense of freedom.

The way my mind spins and spins with hopeless thoughts. The way it poisons everything I do, every relationship I have. Yet it\u2019s addicting, because I know sadness, and I know it very well. And there\u2019s a sort of comfort in that, like being home after a trip or sleeping in your own bed after being away. There\u2019s just a sense that this is where I belong.
