After retiring from NASA, he became a painter. Alan's lecture was called \"The Art of Space Exploration.\" He talked about the mistakes he'd made and how he learned to fix them. One lesson that took him a while to learn was that at a place like NASA you can only have an effect on certain things. You can't control who likes you. You can't control who gets assigned to flights or what NASA's budget is going to be next year. If you get caught up worrying about things you can't control, you'll drive yourself nuts. It's better to focus on the things right in front of you. Identify the places where you can have a positive impact. Concentrate there and let the rest take care of itself. The last thing Alan said to us was 'What most people want in life is to do something great. That doesn't happen often. Don't take it for granted. Don't be blas\u00e9 about it. And don't blow it. A lot of times, believe it or not, people blow it.", "owner": "Mike Massimino, Spaceman: An Astronaut's Unlikely Journey to Unlock the Secrets of the Universe"}, {"item": "Michael wasn't on the pool deck, which was hard for me.
