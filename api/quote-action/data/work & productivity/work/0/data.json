What begins as something like a dream will in fact stay a dream forever unless you have the tools and the discipline to bring it out.", "I don't like work--no man does--but I like what is in the work--the chance to find yourself. Your own reality--for yourself not for others--what no other man can ever know. They can only see the mere show, and never can tell what it really means.", "Pleasure in the job puts perfection in the work.", "Earning happiness means doing good and working, not speculating and being lazy.

And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread-mill is work, while rolling ten-pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.", "Perhaps this is how you know you're doing the thing you're intended to: No matter how slow or how slight your progress, you never feel that it's a waste of time.", "When a man tells you that he got rich through hard work, ask him: 'Whose?", "There will come a time when everybody will know why, for what purpose, there is all this suffering, and there will be no more mysteries.
