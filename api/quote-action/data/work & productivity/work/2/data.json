And by agitation I do not necessarily mean exercise or movement. There is all the difference in the world between agitation and work.Work occupies the body and the mind and is necessary for the health of the spirit. Work can help us to pray and be recollected if we work properly. Agitation, however, destroys the spiritual usefulness of work and even tends to frustrate its physical and social purpose. Agitation is the useless and ill-directed action of the body. It expresses the inner confusion of a soul without peace. Work brings peace to the soul that has a semblance of order and spiritual understanding. It helps the soul to focus upon its spiritual aims and to achieve them. But the whole reason for agitation is to hide the soul from itself, to camouflage its interior conflicts and their purposelessness, and to induce a false feeling that 'we are getting somewhere'.", "owner": "Thomas Merton, No Man Is an Island"}, {"item": "Just because you will not see the work completed does not mean you are free not to take it up.", "owner": "Greg Iles, Turning Angel"}], "pagination": {"next": "/data/work & productivity/work/3/data.json", "prev": "/data/work & productivity/work/1/data.json", "current": "/data/work & productivity/work/2/data.json"}}
