", "The habit of looking at life as a social relation \u2014 an affair of society \u2014 did no good. It cultivated a weakness which needed no cultivation. If it had helped to make men of the world, or give the manners and instincts of any profession \u2014 such as temper, patience, courtesy, or a faculty of profiting by the social defects of opponents \u2014 it would have been education better worth having than mathematics or languages; but so far as it helped to make anything, it helped only to make the college standard permanent through life.", "I\u2019d compare college tuition to paying for a personal trainer at an athletic club. We professors play the roles of trainers, giving people access to the equipment (books, labs, our expertise) and after that, it is our job to be demanding.", "I mean that they (students) should not play life, or study it merely, while the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly live it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as much as mathematics.", "Most people who were educated have become the \"problems\" instead of problem solvers.", "I will miss younot because you taught me,not because you helped me on all steps of education;but only becauseyou made me a leader to lead as an perfect Electrical Engineer.", "You have no idea how many men are spoiled by what is called education.

Students instigate personal development by making calculated and rash personal decisions pertaining to what activities to pursue and by measuring their string of reactions to new experiences.", "As long as high schools strive to list the number of Ivy League schools their graduates attend and teachers pile on work without being trained to identify stress-related symptoms, I fear for our children\u2019s health. I am not mollified by the alums of my daughter\u2019s school who return to tell everyone that the rigor of high school prepared them for college, making their first year easier than they\u2019d anticipated.If they make it that far.", "They [students] had two common, strongly held expectations: the college should exhibit the behavior it expected from students and hold true to its espoused values.", "And the final product of our training must be neither a psychologist nor a brick mason, but a man. And to make men, we must have ideals, broad, pure, and inspiring ends of living, not sordid money-getting... The worker must work for the glory of his handiwork, not simply for pay; the thinker must think for truth, not fame.", "Education leads to intellectual life.", "If you want to be a graduate student, you have to fall in love with reading.", "I had an absurd desire to go down to her and make sure she was all right, and stay with her until dawn.
