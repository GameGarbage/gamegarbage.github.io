But I complain about the police the way the rich complain; not the way the poor complain. The difference is everything.", "The only thing I like about rich people is their money.", "All wars are sacred,\u201d he said. \u201cTo those who have to fight them. If the people who started wars didn\u2019t make them sacred, who would be foolish enough to fight? But, no matter what rallying cries the orators give to the idiots who fight, no matter what noble purposes they assign to wars, there is never but one reason for a war. And that is money. All wars are in reality money squabbles. But so few people ever realize it. Their ears are too full of bugles and drums and the fine words from stay-at-home orators. Sometimes the rallying cry is \u2019save the Tomb of Christ from the Heathen!\u2019 Sometimes it\u2019s \u2019down with Popery!\u2019 and sometimes \u2018Liberty!\u2019 and sometimes \u2018Cotton, Slavery and States\u2019 Rights!", "As I\u2019m fond of saying, if you want to find utopia, take a sharp right on money and a sharp left on sex and it\u2019s straight ahead.", "Like so many women for whom money has always been provided without their understanding how, she was prepared to be a thorough and irresponsible plunger.", "There is no money in poetry, but then there is no poetry in money.", "Nothing feels dirtier than living a life that is not your own. No amount of money is worth my soul. I would rather be homeless and go out in a blaze of glory than subject myself to a slow and steady death of apathy and government by my environment.", "It is not worth having a burden about money. One breathes a sigh of relief when he deposits money in the bank but becomes unhappy when the money is gone. There is nothing in this world worth being relieved about because it is all temporary.", "Rich people do not work for money, they are doing what they like to do", "Why do we need money beyond a point? If we are free of ill health, enmity, and debt, is that not enough? Too much money only leads to less peace.", "While money can't buy happiness, it certainly lets you choose your own form of misery.", "The hardest thing in the world to understand is the income tax.", "Making money isn't hard in itself... What's hard is to earn it doing something worth devoting one's life to.", "Don't think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money.", "There's nothing in the world so demoralizing as money."], "pagination": {"next": "/data/work & productivity/money/2/data.json", "prev": "/data/work & productivity/money/0/data.json", "current": "/data/work & productivity/money/1/data.json"}}
