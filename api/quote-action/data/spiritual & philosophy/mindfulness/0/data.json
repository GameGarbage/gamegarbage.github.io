One of the most significant negative habits we should be aware of is that of constantly allowing our mind to run off into the future. Perhaps we got this from our parents. Carried away by our worries, we're unable to live fully and happily in the present. Deep down, we believe we can't really be happy just yet\u2014that we still have a few more boxes to be checked off before we can really enjoy life. We speculate, dream, strategize, and plan for these \"conditions of happiness\" we want to have in the future; and we continually chase after that future, even while we sleep. We may have fears about the future because we don't know how it's going to turn out, and these worries and anxieties keep us from enjoying being here now.", "owner": "Thich Nhat Hanh, Peace Is Every Breath: A Practice for Our Busy Lives"}, {"item": "The present is all we have, yet it is the one thing we will never learn to hold in our hands.", "owner": "Madeleine Thien, Do Not Say We Have Nothing"}, {"item": "Everything is created twice, first in the mind and then in reality.", "owner": "Robin S.

The incessant stream of thoughts flowing through our minds leaves us very little respite for inner quiet.

Our actions are all too frequently driven rather than undertaken in awareness, driven by those perfectly ordinary thoughts and impulses that run through the mind like a coursing river, if not a waterfall.
