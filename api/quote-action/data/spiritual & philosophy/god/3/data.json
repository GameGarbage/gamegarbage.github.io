If you choose to say, \u2018God can give a creature free will and at the same time withhold free will from it,\u2019 you have not succeeded in saying anything about God: meaningless combinations of words do not suddenly acquire meaning simply because we prefix to them the two other words, 'God can.' It remains true that all things are possible with God: the intrinsic impossibilities are not things but nonentities.
