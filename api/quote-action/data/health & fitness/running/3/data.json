Their training creates a strong work ethic that leaves humility in its wake. There are no short cuts in marathoning, so anyone who is a marathoner has worked hard.", "There are no standards and no possible victories except the joy you are living while dancing your run. You are not running for some future reward-the real reward is now!", "There was no let-up. The tempo was always moderate but steady. If a new guy decided to pick up the pace, that's where it stayed, whether he finished with the group or not. You showed off at your peril.", "He was filled with loss and an off-brand of nostalgia for events that were supposed to become part of his past but now wouldn't at all. In the mind's special processes, a ten-mile run takes far longer than the minutes reported by a grandfather clock. Such time, in fact, hardly exists in the real world; it is all out on the train somewhere, and you only go back to it when you are out there.

He and Nubbins were not even in the same ball park.", "Kim was, as always, utterly happy while running, in accord with nature, in harmony with the universe, in touch with the truth that was in him, full of love for all creatures even to the lowliest insect.", "The words of the social critic Eric Hoffer were ringing true: \"Every great cause begins as a movement, becomes a business, and turns into a racket.", "The true runner is a very fortunate person. He has found something in him that is just perfect.", "As every runner knows, running is about more than just putting one foot in front of the other; it is about our lifestyle and who we are.", "There's one rule of thumb that suggests that you need one day of recovery for every mile run in a race.
