I can attest that you will be happier, healthier, and more successful at it.", "Because all actions and expressions stem from the mind, it is vital to know the mind as well as decide in what way we\u2019ll use it. Everyone has heard of psychosomatic illness, and most of us acknowledge that psychosomatic sicknesses can and do occur. But what about psychosomatic wellness? How many of us have considered if it\u2019s possible to stay healthy or cure various maladies with the positive use of the mind? And if we have thought of this, have we done much more than simply consider the idea?", "Relax and Recreat yourself.", "When I travel, I get lovesick. Well, they call it chlamydia.", "All I want is some man to take delight in me. 5:30? 6:30 A.M. as usual, no cigs. Better a maudlin drunk than a sterile one. My pimples are more like small boils; I have the plague. My lip is split. My tits are swollen and I can't ever sleep. I now breathe with my heart, which skips rope.

It is like a rubber band. As long as the groups that compose society are flexible and social and emotionally supporting, it serves its constituency well. It bends, weaves, twists, turns, and envelops everyone in diverse manners. If opposing forces become too locked into their polarized viewpoints, though, other things happen.Like two grumpy siblings, they hold their views with anger or self-righteousness and utter vulgar and crass words, but it amounts to the same thing. The two groups pull on the rubber band and rigidly hold to their position without empathy.The rubber band (society) grows taut and then eventually it snaps and collateral damage ensues and the proverbial baby is thrown out with the bath water.", "A healthy society begins with healthy individuals."], "pagination": {"next": "/data/health & fitness/health/3/data.json", "prev": "/data/health & fitness/health/1/data.json", "current": "/data/health & fitness/health/2/data.json"}}
